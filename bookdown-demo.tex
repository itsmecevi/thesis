After fast 8 years of hard work with the study at Berlin University of
applied Sciences (HTW Berlin). From Studientkolleg till this Master, I
am now ready to face new challenges in the real world in my country
Indonesia. Writing this thesis has been interesting experience an also
my las work in university life. I have faced some difficulties but none
that have stopped me to complete this work. This thesis would not be
possible without help from the amazing people at that i meet in
University and at works.

This thesis based on my experience as internship and working student in
different company from 2015 till February 2019. And I took the use case
for this thesis in my last works in Deutsche Bahn from September 2019
till February 2019.

I would like to announce special thanks to Fathimah Dzakiyyah, my
beloved wife. And all of my family. I would also like to thank
Prof.~Dr.~Christians and Prof.~Dr.~Beate Bergter who has been inspring
me.

Last but not least I would like to thank my friends, Christ, Mathel,
Jabr, Ouafaa, and Hourya. They has been a continuous source of
inspiration and always been very helpful.

\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}

\textbf{Background: }Big Data can be defined as high Volume and Variety
of data that can be brought together and analyzed at high Velocity to
discover patterns and make better decisions. Deutsche Bahn as a
multinational company have also data growth from the company activities.
The KPI (Key Performances Indicator) helps a big data to more
understable in easily visualization. A right KPI should act as a gage,
helping company understand whether the company is taking the right path
toward the strategic goals. I have decided to investigate further of how
Deutsche Bahn operates with KPIs from they Big Data.

\textbf{Purpose: } The purpose of this thesis is to examine the
reception of Big Data Key Performance Indicators used at Deutsche Bahn
Headquarters. Investigate how Big Data KPIs evaluate their way of daily
monitoring. See if there is room for further improvements and also if
the findings are applicable in other company (another Deutsche Bahn
company).

\textbf{Method: } I decided to do only quantitative-approach when
collecting data. The quantitative data were retrieved from SAP Business
Object Web Intelligence Database. Because of data privacy at Deutsche
Bahn, the data that I used in this thesis isn't data from Deutsche Bahn,
but I tried to get similar manner data from another sources. In Use Case
part I created the analysis for problem solving from scratch (from the
very beginning, especially without making use of or relying on any
previous work for assistance).

\textbf{Conclusions: }

Deutsche Bahn uses KPIs in order to Increase sales, profit and to get
useful information from their big data that can be analyzed. It is up to
each and every sub departments to decide if and how they want to work
with the KPIs. Deutsche Bahn Headquarters is successful when operating
with big data KPIs. The teams get motivated by working with big data KPI
and feel that they can affect the outcome to at least a sufficient
extent. There are not many negative things to say about how Deutsche
Bahn Headquarters operates with KPIs but there is room for improvements.
We believe that other departments might be inspired of how Deutsche Bahn
Headquarters operates with KPIs.

\chapter{Data is everywhere}\label{data-is-everywhere}

Do you have smartphone? Off course, this kind of Ask is not relevant in
this era. From our Laptop, Tablet, PC or Handphone. This devices creates
more data nowadays. Data is more bigger and bigger. The world contains
an astronomical amount of data, an amount that grows larger and larger
each day. This Big Data has changed the way the world interacts,
uncovered breakthroughs in fast all of our life, from ecommerce,
medicine, genetic, financial etc.

The principle of Big Data works that the more you have data about
anything or any situation, the more accurately you get new
\textbf{insights} and make \textbf{predictions} about what will happen
in the future. Also revealed new ways to understand trends in business
and in our daily lives. By comparing more and more data and creating
relationships that were previously hidden enable us to learn and make
more smarter decisions on targeting business values such as sales,
production, or financial situations.

The big four (Deloitte, Ernst \& Young (EY), KPMG and
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)) are the four biggest professional services
networks in the world. They did also so many research about this theme.
One of the interesting information are in the paper ``Gut \& gigabytes''
from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).

The point is that executives rely more on experience and advice than
data to make business-fefining choices but the data driven cultures
could be impact more for decision making.

\textbf{The summary of this paper:}

\begin{quote}
Highly data-driven companies are three times more likely to report
significant improvement in making big decisions, but only 1 in 3
executives say their organisation is highly data-driven.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
More big decisions are made opportunistically than deliberately, and big
decisions have big impact on future profitability; nearly 1 in 3
executives value those decisions at \$1 billion+
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Many executives sceptical or frustrated by the practical application of
data and analytics for big decisions, especially in emerging markets
\end{quote}

And the five important issues in this survei are growing the existing
business, collaborating with competitors, shrinking the existing
business, entering a new industry or starting a new business, and
corporate financing.

\section{Big data definition}\label{big-data-definition}

As data becomes more bigger, manipulating of available data to get
insights and make business decisions can be a useful. Statistical
methods, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data
manipulation are some of new term that every business leaders at every
level need to become data literate and be able to understand data and
analytical concepts.

Before going further, what is actually Big data?. Big data term comes
from John Mashey in 1990, a computer scientist from Pennsylvania State
University. It all starts with the big bang explosion in the amount of
data we have created since the rise of the digital era. Side effects of
the rise of computers, the Internet and technology that capable of
capturing data from the all kind of electronic processing.

Big Data have 3 defining properties call 3V. This terms introduces by
\texttt{Gartner\ analyst\ Doug\ Laney} in a 2001 MetaGroup research
publication. He publisched that publication with the title ``3D data
management: Controlling data volume, variety and velocity''. Also not
all data is big data except they have 3 properties. Some others data
expert added another 2V, value and veracity, but the main term is always
3V.

\textbf{1. Volume:} Volume refers to the huge amounts of data generated
each time from all of electronics device such as website, social media,
cell phones, cars, credit cards, sensors, photographs, video, etc.
Volume is the V most associated with the term of big data because,
volume can be incredible exploding big. Below is the explanation of how
data growing rapidly from sisense.com (Figure 1.8)

For Example in internet world. Facebook is storing 250 billion images As
far back as 2016, Facebook had 2.5 trillion posts. Can you imagine for
the others online media such as twitter, blog, instagram and also our
searching in google? It is a extreme amount of data. This link show the
live statistics of some online area such as facebook, twitter., internet
users, etc.

\textbf{2. Variety:} It refers to many sources and data types
(structured and unstructured). Not only spreadsheet and database but
also emails, photos, videos, monitoring devices, audio, etc.

\textbf{3. velocity:} There are four velocity type in big data.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Batch
\item
  Periodic
\item
  Near real time
\item
  Real time
\end{itemize}

``Firehose'' data sources such as social media and E-commerce need
quickly analytics. Most importantly, use it at a faster rate than ever
before. Using real-time alerting, Walmart company was able to find a
particular Halloween novelty cookie of its stores where it wasn't
selling at all. More than realtime but predictive analytics.

IBM are below (Figure 1.13).

There has been an rapidly growth in the field of Big Data with the
benefits of the rising the new technology. This availability of big data
has led to the use of big data in multiple industries ranging from

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Banking
\item
  Healthcare
\item
  Energy
\item
  Technology
\item
  Consumer
\item
  Manufacturing
\item
  etc
\end{itemize}

The next section are example use case big data in some of industries
(our case studies: transportation and logistics industries and another
industry).

\section{T \& L industry: Deutsche
Bahn}\label{t-l-industry-deutsche-bahn}

Deutsche Bahn AG is a German railway company as the second-largest
transport company in the world, after the German postal and logistics
company Deutsche Post / DHL, and is the largest railway operator and
infrastructure owner in Europe. Headquartered in Berlin, it is a private
joint-stock company (AG), with the Federal Republic of Germany being its
single shareholder.

The Deutsche Bahn Group is divided with some subsidiaries, such as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Personenverkehr
\item
  Arriva
\item
  DB Fernverkehr
\item
  DB Regio
\item
  DB Netze
\item
  DB Engineering \& Consulting
\item
  Logistics
\item
  ect
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{db.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Deutsche Bahn Group (DB Group) is an international provider of mobility
and logistics services operating globally in more than 130 countries. DB
Group has more than 310,000 employees, with almost 40\% employed outside
Germany.

In passenger transport, we transport more than 12.5 million people each
day on our trains and buses throughout Europe. In freight transport and
logistics, our European network transports over 270 million t of goods
per year by rail, and over 100 million shipments by road. Our global
networks move about 1.3 million t of freight by air and nearly 2.2
million TEU by sea. At about 33,000 km, our rail network in Germany is
Europe's longest. We are also the fifth-largest energy provider in
Germany. The main components of our integrated rail system are our
passenger transport activities in Germany, our rail freight transport
activities, the operating service units and the rail infrastructure
companies (RIC).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{db2.JPG}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

As an operator of networks and provider of services in passenger
transport, freight transport and logistics, as well as track
infrastructure, our economic success is influenced by the general
economic environment and the specific development of the various
relevant markets.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{db3.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

There are four key success factors in the development of DB Group, which
are a central component of DB Group's business model:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Entrepreneurial approach to business: in the course of the German rail
  reform DB Group has established itself as a commercial enterprise.
  Particularly worth mentioning in this context are the establishment of
  a modern and efficient organization and a value-based management
  approach with capital market viability as a target.
\item
  Integrated Group: as a system integrator in Germany, DB Group
  optimizes the integrated rail system. In doing so, it serves as an
  important driving force for technological innovation. The integrated
  Group structure enables us to achieve positive synergies and align our
  infrastructure to support efficiency, market orientation and
  profitability.
\item
  International position: due to our focus on Europe in passenger
  transport as well as our European and global orientation in the areas
  of freight transport and logistics activities, DB Group has an
  excellent position in the relevant markets. As a result, we are
  responding to the increasing demand for cross-border solutions. At the
  same time, we are best positioned to take advantage of growth
  opportunities.
\item
  Cross-modal transport solutions: we offer our customers door-to-door
  mobility and logistics solutions from a single source. We use digital
  technologies to intelligently link various modes of transport in an
  economical and environmentally friendly way. In addition, we offer
  complementary products and services in the freight transport and
  logistics market.
\end{enumerate}

One of the subsidiary company that focusing on big data analytics to
achive that key succes factors is DB Systel Gmbh
(\url{https://www.dbsystel.de/dbsystel}). The key point of DB Systel
are:

\textbf{Big data}

If the data can no longer be stored by conventional databases, it is
known as big data. We need mathematical methods, statistical, machine
learning, and alghorithms to get insigh from the big data.

\textbf{Business intelligence/business analytics}

The process to collected, analysed, and visualized data, either as bar
graph, pie chart or another form. The KPI (Key Performance Indicators)
are the main end results from this process. And support decision making
in the present and also future

\textbf{Data mining}

The three main concepts of data mining are statistics, mathematics, and
alghorithms. To detect the hidden patterns and connections in big data
we need some methods, such as clustering (formation of groups of similar
data), regression analysis (what depends on which other factors?) and
association (if one thing happens, another does too)

\textbf{Data lake}

Every day, individual generates around 650 megabytes of data. There is a
lake of data. Creating the data lake is a logical way of helping company
to get flexible access to all of the data sources. A data lake is a
central location where every department can store external and internal
data (structured and unstructured data at any scale).

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

Data Lakes compared to Data Warehouses.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{datalake.PNG}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Smart data}

While big data and the data lake consist of structured data and
unstructured data, smart data have a specific purpose using certain
algorithms and other tools. Smart data developed and improving a
business processes and decision-making. The smart data consist also the
analytics Edge, such as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Descriptive analytics
\item
  Predictive analytics
\item
  Prescriptive analytics
\end{itemize}

The description of this three analytics edge you can find in the next
chapter \texttt{3.\ Big\ Data\ Analytics}

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

Like most other industries, transportation and logistics (T\&L) is
currently confronting immense change and like all change, this brings
both risk and opportunity. This risk and opportunity have new
technology, new market, new customers expectation, and new business
modell. Based on pwc (PricewaterhouseCoopers) research, there are four
disruption and uncertainty and five forces transforming in the era of
big data for T\&L industry (Transportation \& Logistik).

\textbf{Four areas of disruption and uncertainty:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Changing customer expectations
\end{enumerate}

Like individual consumers, industrial customers now expect to get
shipments faster, more flexibly, and with more transparency at a lower
price. No surprise that across the industry, both operating models and
profitability are under strain. And the pace of transformation for large
manufacturing and retail customers may turn out to be even faster than
for private final consumers.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Technological breakthroughs
\end{enumerate}

Technology is changing every aspect of how logistics companies operate.
`Digital fitness' will be a prerequisite for success: the winners will
be those who understand how to exploit a whole range of new
technologies, from data analytics to automation and platform solutions.
Those who don't, risk obsolescence. But with so many technologies
competing for management attention and investment, defining a clear
digital strategy that's integrated into business strategy will be
critical.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{pwc2.PNG}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  New entrants to the industry
\end{enumerate}

Platform technology has given rise to new business models, often driven
by start-ups that enter the logistics industry. New `sharing' business
models could have as much of an impact on the sector as new technology.
And the industry's current customers and suppliers may end up being the
biggest new entrants.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  Redefining collaboration
\end{enumerate}

Horizontal collaboration is already happening, especially in last-mile
delivery, but it's hampered by inconsistencies. Higher levels of
efficiency could be achieved by more consistent standards, defined
through the Physical Internet and increased collaboration, whether in
the form of alliances, joint ventures or M\&A.

\textbf{Five Forces Transforming Transport \& Logistics:}

As the complexity of modern transport and logistics grows, it is
increasingly difficult to understand what to focus on, so PWC have
identified five key forces transforming the T\&L segment:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Digitalization
\item
  Shifts in international trade
\item
  Software-driven process changes
\item
  Changes in markets' domestic commerce
\item
  Machine-driven process changes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Another industry}\label{another-industry}

\subsection{Agriculture}\label{agriculture}

Agriculture businesses are using big data to improve production and
yields and improve forecasting to better optimize supply chains. Getting
deep insight through big data is important to highing product quality or
rising sales and market share.

As agribusinesses growth and more diverse, the growing of data that must
be managed are also becoming more huge and complex. The data comes from
not only social media outlets and supplier network channels but also
agricultural devices sensor and machine equipment. Today these data
sources come from:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Traditional enterprise data from operational systems
\item
  Farm field sensor data (e.g.~temperature, humidity, rainfall,
  sunlight)
\item
  Farm equipment sensor data (from tractors, plows, and harvesters)
\item
  Harvested goods and livestock delivery vehicles (from farms to
  processing facilities) sensor data
\item
  Commodities trade data
\item
  Financial data
\item
  Weather data
\item
  Animal and plant genomics research data
\item
  Social media
\end{itemize}

Big Data can help improve forecasting and efficiency and lead precisely
decision making. Big data technologies enable agricultural sectors to
analyze a variety of data sources, in turn leading to better outcomes.
Agribusinesses have long lists of needed metrics. But which data that we
need and where the data come from and also what is the outcome or
beneficially result. Following is a list of areas where Big Data
technologies can impact in agricultural sectors:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Weather data from weather institution for better understanding time to
  plants
\item
  Improved forecasting of yields and production data from Farm field
  sensor data (e.g. temperature, humidity, rainfall, sunlight)
\item
  Better optimized seeds and livestock and new methodologies that
  improve yields and production with Farm equipment sensor data such as
  warehouse sensor data
\item
  Faster delivery of goods produced to distribution centers and
  consumers with street data or vehicle (car) sensor data
\item
  Real-time decisions and alerts based on data from fields and equipment
  with Farm equipment sensor data or Farm field sensor data
\item
  Integrated production and business performance data for improved
  decision making with ERP system from integrated all sensor devices and
  sales data.
\item
  Rationalized performance data across multiple geographies with sales
  data
\item

\subsection{Automotive}\label{automotive}

The automotive industry face a compleks challenges. One thing that has
the opportunity to deliver solution is analytics. Shifting marketing
conditions, volatility, competition, and cost pressure are the problem
to change in the automotive industry.

As the automobile is being transformed by big data technologies
(everything from sensors to artifical intelligence to big data
analysis). The ecosystem are change and the analytics allows the data
not only structured but also unstructured data such as videos, sound
recording, or texts to be analyze- the results are impressive.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{15.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Below are the key points to deep undestand the automative industry:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Use the data for actionable customer segments and
  individualised offers and to boost sales and also improve customer
  retention.}
\end{itemize}

Customer behaviour analytics: Customer need a consistent personalised
experience across their access channels.Automakers are having to sell by
offering 24/7 connectivity and reliance on social media and internet as
communication tool. There is a huge of data available to support
automakers for understand their customers but automakers have limits and
ability to collect, analyse, and act on it.

Automakers need to fully understand customers needs and behaviours to
develop a bird view of customer segmentation. For example, the
combination of online retailing and physical stores to build brand
awareness, attract new target and transformational retailing experience
for shopping anytime and anywhere. At least but not last, customer
retention needs to be placed high on the strategy, understanding the
customer experience with the lifecycle and journey not only just during
the purchase.

The example of real strategy:

\begin{quote}
Inner city mobility: Pay for use customer mobility solution, covering
central city locations, offering ease, speed and flexibility of commute
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Urban lifestyle convenience: Taking direct retailing and servicing
business to the consumer
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Regional retailing: Providing the complete digitised brand experience
through existing dealers
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Applying big data analysis to a mass historical data to
  identify the impact of fixed and variable marketing parameters and
  suppport auto industry with a more precise and effective approach to
  quantity and composition of marketing cost.}
\end{itemize}

The growth in data and information available on customers is allowing
automakers and dealers to focus on spesific customers. To make this
happens, automakers bring togethers internal and external information
sources relating to variable marketing spend to better undestand what`s
working and what isn´t. Besides that, there are some issue that must be
overcome, including:

\begin{quote}
Lack of available data on transaction for internal and competitor
brands.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Less understanding of competitor marketing and strategies
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Differences in customer behaviours across different region and customer
segments
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Less ability to understand the impact of trends on market and buying
behaviours
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Supply chain data can reveal which links in chain could weaken
  allowing for proactive and timely countermeasure before real problem
  manifests.}
\end{itemize}

Globalising operations to take adventage of high-growth markets, driving
innovative strategies to optimise manufacturing process. Get it right
and gain a competitive advantage and drive growth. Get it wrong and
automakers can get difficult scenarios from parts shortages, government
security, or lost growth opportunities. Moreover, advanced suppy chain
analytics can help automakers analyse larget dataset using analytical
and mathematical techniques. An example of this is the use of product
configuration and web interactions which allow automakers to get early
of emerging trends and forecast.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Predictive analytics for forecasting efficiency as well as
  operations and performance.}
\end{itemize}

The good news is that predictive quality analytics capabilities
available today allow quality issues to be detected and taken prevented.
This news provided improved ability to better manager customer
satisfaction and cost control concerns.

\subsection{Retail}\label{retail}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{16.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

The sphere of the retail industry develop rapidly. Besides that, retail
industry is the top use case of big data. The retailers manage to
analyze data from different sources and develop overview of a customer
to learn targeting sales. Besides that, a customer need to be easily
influenced by the strategy develop by another retailer. New sources of
data, from machine data (log files) and transaction, to sensor and
social media, present opportunities for retailers to get impacted value
and competitive advanced. To achieve this is to make best plans and
decisions, undertand customer more deeply, uncover hidden trends, and
becoming data driven organisation.

This examples presents top big data analytics use cases in the retail,
created for retailers to be aware about trends and tendencies using big
data.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Customer Behavior Analytics for Retail: Retailers can combine,
  integrate and analyze all of your external and internal data to
  generate the deeply or hidden insights.
\item
  Customer Journey Analytics: Today's customers are more connected than
  before. Using mobile devices, social media and e-commerce, customers
  can access all of information in seconds. With big data technologies,
  retailers can bring data into powerful insights. Retailers will be
  able to get deeply understanding this questions such as:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What is s really happening across every step in the customer journey?
\item
  Who are your high-value customers and how they behave?
\item
  How and when is it best to reach them?
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Personalizing the In-Store Experience With Big Data
\end{enumerate}

Big data analytics can turn data sources into advantage for retailers.
These data sources can be gathered from:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Websites
\item
  Point of sales systems
\item
  Mobile apps
\item
  Supply chain systems
\item
  In store sensors
\item
  Cameras and more
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  Increasing conversion rates through predictive analytics and targeted
  promotions
\end{enumerate}

To reduce costs and high customer acquisition, retailers need targeting
promotions. This requires a 360-degree view of customers situation.

In the past, customer infromation has been limited to demographic data
during sales transactions. But today, customers interact more than they
transact, as example is social media. Using data from internal or
external sources, omni-channel retailers can:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Test and quantify the impact of different promotional tactics on
  customer behavior and conversion
\item
  Use a customer purchase and browsing history to identify needs and
  interests and then personalize promotions for customers
\item
  Monitor customer purchasing behavior and social media activity to
  drive timely offers to customers to incent online purchases with a
  specific retailer
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\tightlist
\item
  Recommendation engines
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{17.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Recommendation engines is one of tools for customers behaviour
prediction. Recommendation engines provided retailers to increase sales
and to dictate trends. Recommendation engines depend on the choices by
the customers. Usually, this engines use either collaborative filtering
or content based recommendation.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Collaborative Filtering:
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{A.PNG}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

This system based on how similar users liked the item. As example, Cevi
and Herdian have similar interests in games. Cevi buyed and played
``Game of Thrones 4''. Herdia has not played this game. But the system
recommend this game because the system has learned that Cevi and Herdian
have similar interests. In simple words, users who liked this game also
like too.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Content-based Recommendations:
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{18.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

The company must have detailed metadata (details data explanation about
the data) about each of buyers. Retailers can recommend buyers with
similar tags. For example, Fathimah watch the movies ``Game of Thrones
1'' on Netflix. This movie may have metadata tags of ``War'', so Netflix
recommends to Fathimah another movis with metadata tags ``Ancient''.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\tightlist
\item
  Market basket analysis (transaction data)
\end{enumerate}

Market basket analysis may be regarded as traditional analysis in the
retail. This it a modelling method based on the theory that you buy a
certain items, you are more (or less) to buy another items. This process
mainly depend on the amount of data collected via customers
transactions. It works by looking for combinations of items in
transactions. Association Rules are widely used to analyze retail basket
or transaction data. An example of step by step Association Rules are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Assume there are 1000 customers
\item
  100 of them bought only CD games, 850 bought Playstation and 50 bought
  both of them.
\item
  Bought CD games =\textgreater{} bought playstation
\item
  Support = P(CD games \& Playstation) = 50/1000 = 0.05
\item
  Confidence = support/P(Playstation) = 0.05/(850/1000) = 0.05/0.85=0.06
\item
  Lift = confidence/P(Milk) = 0.75/0.10 = 7.5
\end{itemize}

Note:

\begin{quote}
Support:= the number of transactions that include items in the \{A\} and
\{B\} parts of the rule as a percentage of the total number of
transactions.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Confidence:= the ratio of the number of transactions that include all
items in \{B\} as well as the number of transactions that include all
items in \{A\} to the number of transactions that include all items in
\{A\}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
lift:= the ratio of confidence to expected confidence. Expected
confidence is the confidence divided by the frequency of B
\end{quote}

\includegraphics{19.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Fraud can encompass abuse and wate, improper payments money laundring,
terrorist financing, cybersecurity and public security. The detection of
fraud is important and challenging activity of retailers. The only good
way to protect retailers is to be one step ahead of fraudsters.

To identify of fraud-while improving customers experienceces-retailers
should follow four steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Extract and transform all available data types from across departments
  or channels and incorporate them into the analytical process.
\item
  Continually monitor transactions, social networks, high-risk
  anomalies, etc., and apply behavioral analytics to enable real-time
  decision making.
\item
  Intstall analytics culture through data visualization at all levels,
  including investigative workflow optimization.
\item
  Employ layered security techniques (another company who experts in
  this area).
\item
  Warranty analytics
\end{enumerate}

With warranty issues costing retailers billions and indirect cost
factors. To reduce warranty costs, build loyalty customer service, smart
manufactures, and focus on post-sales service. The methods of detecting
are complicated. They concentrate on the detecting anomalies in the
warranty claims.

The warranty analytics have some of challenges:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Increasing warranty costs and poor customer satisfaction ratings.
\item
  Cannot track warranty claims and resolutions in a timely manner.
\item
  New issues grow in the field for months before they are detected.
\item
  Hard to integrate and analyze historical/supplier warranty
  information, so it is difficult to anticipate and prepare for future
  issues.
\item
  Business analysts and executives do not have ready access to warranty
  data and reports.
\item
  Difficulty integrating quality and warranty data.
\item
  Root cause analysis takes too long.
\item
  Feeding warranty claim information back to design and manufacturing
  takes too long.
\item
  Ineffective, manually intensive processes.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{8}
\tightlist
\item
  Customer sentiment analysis
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{20.jpg}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Social networks (social media) and online services feedbacks can perform
the sentiment analysis. Because social media data are available,also
much easier to implement analytics on social platforms. This analysis
uses language processing to know a positive ot negative attitude of
customer. The results are as a insight fro services improvement.

The examples are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I do not dislike this games. (Negation handling)
\item
  Disliking a games is not really my thing. (Negation, inverted word
  order)
\item
  Sometimes I really hate the Gun. (Adverbial modifies the sentiment)
\item
  I'd really truly love going out in this weather! (Possibly sarcastic)
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{9}
\tightlist
\item
  Price optimization
\end{enumerate}

Pricing optimization is the setting a price to maximize profits. It is
driven by the supply and demand data, behavioural data, competition
data,etc. The right price for customers and retailers is significant
advantage brought by optimization method. The price depends not only on
the costs to produce but on the the competition. The big data analysis
bring this issue to the next level. The data come from many sources and
define buying attitude, seasoning, competitor pricing, etc. The
alghorithm define the response the changes in prices. Using the real
time optimization the retaliers have an advantage to attract more
customers and to build personal pricing schemes.

Below are overview four 6 pricing strategies with big data:

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Premium pricing: Retailers set costs higher than their competitors
  with premium services or items.
\item
  Pricing for Market Penetration: Retailers offer lower prices on goods
  and services for first time opened.
\item
  Bundle Pricing: Buy 1 get 1 pricing.
\item
  Psychology Pricing: For example, setting the price of a watch at \$499
  is proven to attract more consumers than setting it at \$500.
\item
  Price Skimming: The retaliers offer lowers prices as competitor goods
  appear on the market not only for the first time opened.
\item
  Economy Pricing: An example of economy pricing is generic food sold at
  grocery stores. The generic They need little marketing and promotion
  expenses.is incredibly effective for large retailers companies.
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{10}
\tightlist
\item
  Location of new stores
\end{enumerate}

Data analytics is efficient about this issue. The method is simple and
also useful. The data are customers data, ZIP code and location for
understanding the market potential. The Analyst find the solution by
connection all the data source.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{11}
\tightlist
\item
  Lifetime value prediction
\end{enumerate}

The customer lifetime value (LTV) is one of the most important parameter
in retail industry. CLV is a total value of customers profit to the
retailer over the entire customer business relationship. Retail can
measure how long to it takes to retargeting the investment required to
earn the customers.

The forecast are made on the past data to the most recent tarnsactions
data. The application of the statistical methodology and machine
learning helps retailer to identify customers buying pattern. It is a
important business process for the retailers. More customers
understanding, more high LTV value.

\subsection{Financial Services}\label{financial-services}

Big data analytics can be the main driver of innovation in the financial
industry. Using big data analytics in the financial industry is more
than a trend, it has become the core analytics. The Banks and Insurances
company have to realize that big data can help them more efficient,
smarter decisions, and improve performance. This can be applied to the
following activities:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Banking and Insurance Industry:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Discovering the spending patterns of the customers
  \item
    Identifying the main channels of transactions (ATM withdrawal,
    credit/debit card payments)
  \item
    Splitting the customers into segments according to their profiles
  \item
    Product cross-selling based on the customers' segmentation
  \item
    Fraud management \& prevention
  \item
    Risk assessment, compliance \& reporting
  \item
    Customer feedback analysis and application
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Only Insurance Industry:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Better product design and marketing
  \item
    More accurate risk assessment, underwriting, and pricing processes
  \item
    Stronger commitment to helping customers
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Only Banking Industry:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Better claims management
  \item
    Better customer targeting and ensuring growth
  \item
    Enhancing risk assessment
  \item
    Improving productivity and decision-making
  \item
    More business opportunities
  \item
    Digital banks -- internet-based banks
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Here is a list of data science use cases in banking area:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Fraud detection
\end{enumerate}

Machine learning is effective detection and prevention of fraud include
credit cards, accounting, insurance, and more. The key steps to fraud
detection include: Obtaining data samplings for model estimation and
preliminary testing Model estimation Testing stage and deployment.

The fraud detection need the deep theoritical knowledge into practical
applications. Several alghorithms are needed, such as association,
clustering, forecasting, and classification. The simple example of
efficient fraud detection is outlier data. When some unusually high
transactions finded or it can investigate unusually high purchase of
popular items and multiple accounts.

Palmer (2014) suggests that the following stages of enterprise counter
fraud measures:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Detect:} By applying advanced analytics to all key fraud data
  to aid in predicting if an action is potentially fraudulent. 
\item
  \textbf{Respond:} Applying fraud insights to take action in real time.
  
\item
  \textbf{Investigate:} By performing and manag-ing inquiries into
  suspicious activity that are supported by data analysis and
  col-laborative sophisticated case management. 
\item
  \textbf{Discover:} Using new big data analytics capabilities that help
  in the identifica-tion of suspicious activity by analyzing historical
  data to search for patterns of fraud and financial crimes.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Marketing
\end{enumerate}

Xerago (2015) defines marketing analyt-ics as the practice of measuring,
managing and analyzing market performance to maximize the effectiveness
of and return on investment (ROI) from the marketing activities. The
marketing analytics will help banks through data to increase
profitability. Pramanick (2013) states that banks are always at risk of
losing customers and need strategies that are dependent in identifying
the right ac-tion to the right customer. Thus banks need customer
analytics to segment the customers. This marketing will assist in
determining products and services, pricing, and strategy of the banks.

Morabito (2015) adds that big data ena-bled marketing automation will
assist banks in servicing individual customer needs while keep-ing the
marketing costs low, enabling a person-alized experience at a good ROI.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Credit Risk Management
\end{enumerate}

Sas (sas.com: one of leading analytics software company) defines credit
risk as the probability of loss due to a borrower's failure to make
payments on any type of debt. Better credit risk presents an opportunity
and improve performance and also competitive advantage.

Due to sas institute (sas.com), credit risk have also challenges, such
as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Inefficient data management}: An inability to access the right
  data when it's needed causes problematic delays.
\item
  \textbf{No groupwide risk modeling framework}: Without it, banks can't
  generate complex, meaningful risk measures and get a big picture of
  groupwide risk.
\item
  \textbf{Constant rework}: Analysts can't change model parameters
  easily, which results in too much duplication of effort and negatively
  affects a bank's efficiency ratio.
\item
  \textbf{Insufficient risk tools}: Without a robust risk solution,
  banks can't identify portfolio concentrations or re-grade portfolios
  often enough to effectively manage risk.
\item
  \textbf{Cumbersome reporting}: Manual, spreadsheet-based reporting
  processes overburden analysts and IT.
\end{itemize}

The solution should include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Better model management that spans the entire modeling life cycle.
\item
  Real-time scoring and limits monitoring.
\item
  Robust stress-testing capabilities.
\item
  Data visualization capabilities and business intelligence tools that
  get important information into the hands of those who need it, when
  they need it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Crime \& Terorism}\label{crime-terorism}

Some police are starting to use big data to predict crime. The use of
fingerprints, DNA, ballistic analysis, CCTV and other types of
technology have also played to improve big data analytics in crime. Top
use case is predictive analytics. This helps in this aspect:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Police can make compelling cases to get emergency resources to fight
  recent crime waves
\item
  Police can identify the likelihood that they are dealing with serial
  offenders
\item
  Police can look for precipitating factors that cause crime epidemics
  and pass that information along to policymakers to take preventive
  measures
\end{itemize}

Thhe success story of crime prediction are come from RUSI (Royal United
Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies). They published a
paper ``Big Data and Policing An Assessment of Law Enforcement
Requirements, Expectations and Priorities''. One to the success project
is \textbf{Predictive Crime Mapping}

\textbf{How Predictive Crime Mapping Works:}

Big data analytics has been used for a decade for predictive crime
mapping, and the technology continues to be developed and advanced. On
the basic level, this technology is very simple and that are based on:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Crime type
\item
  Date
\item
  Time
\item
  Crime locations
\end{itemize}

Police officers are printing out their predictive maps to use on patrol
to combat crime in high mapping crime.

**Issues Presented by Using Past Crime \url{Data:**}

These big data solutions are also learning from the past, so the
information can be discriminatory or bias as a result. Example:

100 crimes occurred in the area by males in the past two years. The same
can be inputted for age, religion and race. So, it does present a system
that may create a bias and reinforce this in the police force. If John
Doe is convicted of rape, and all of his rapes occurred on High Street,
algorithms may be able to suggest John Doe as a rapist if:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Rapes occurred on High Street
\item
  Rapes occurred at around the same time as his previous convictions
\item
  Similar women were raped
\end{itemize}

Of course, it may not be John Doe, but this form of predictive modeling
is an option with big data. It may be possible to scour records, looking
for similar crimes with similar circumstances and tying them together.

\section{Data Analytics Lifecycle}\label{data-analytics-lifecycle}

One of the most method for data analytics is \textbf{CRISP-DM
methodology. } The method was found by five companies: SPSS, Teradata,
Daimler AG, NCR Corporation, and OHRA (an insurance company). The
CRISP-DM methodology stands for Cross Industry Standard Process for Data
Mining. It is a robust and well-proven methodology. This model is an
idealised iterative method. Take a look the following illustration.

\textbf{Stage One- Determine Business Objectives }

This initial phase focuses on understanding the project objectives and
requirements from a business perspective. The goal of this stage is to
uncover important factors for improving business. Neglecting this step
can mean that a great deal of effort is put into producing the right
answers to the wrong questions.

What are the desired outputs of the project?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Set objectives }-It means describing the primary objective
  from a business perspective. For example, your primary goal might be
  to keep current customers by predicting when they are prone to move to
  a competitor. The questions are ``Does the channel used affect whether
  customers stay or go?'' or ``Will lower ATM fees significantly reduce
  the number of high-value customers who leave?''.
\item
  \textbf{Produce project plan }-It describe the plan for achieving
  business needs (improving sales, reduce cost, ect). This step include
  the initial selection of tools and techniques.
\item
  \textbf{Business success criteria }-The successful criteria from the
  business point of view. The criteria should be specific and
  measurable, such as cost reduction or significant sales growth.
\end{enumerate}

Assess the current situation

This involves more details about another factors that company will need
when determining goals.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Inventory of resources }: The resources available to
  determining business objects including:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Personnel (business experts, data experts, technical support, data
    mining experts)
  \item
    Data (fixed extracts, access to live, warehoused, or operational
    data)
  \item
    Computing resources (hardware platforms and software)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Requirements, assumptions and constraints }: The list of
  requirements objects that company need. From scheduling, quality
  parameter, data security, and legal issues. Including the assumption
  of the the factors such as verification data and also constraints like
  availability of resources.
\item
  \textbf{Risks and contingencies }: The list of delay project and fail
  probability. what company take if the risk take place?.
\item
  \textbf{Terminology }-A glossary of relevant business and data mining
  terminology.
\item
  Costs and benefits

\section{Modern Data Analytics}\label{modern-data-analytics}

\section{Analytics Paradigm}\label{analytics-paradigm}

Analytics helps company answer the business questions. What happened in
the past, what happen in the future, and what decisions company can make
to improving future performance. Nowadays, data analytics is very
important and more and more universities and further education programms
are creating analytics learning environments. \texttt{Tom\ Davenport}
from CIO (Chief Information Officer) Magazine divided analytics area
into three main types of analytics. The three main components of
analytics is as follows:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{analytics.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Descriptive Analytics: }

Descriptive Analytics helps company to get insight from the past and
current state of business. Most every business function in the company
(Production, Sales, Finance, etc.) used Descriptive Analytics to create
custom reports.

Overview:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Question being answered: What happened and why?
\item
  Examples of tools used: Data aggregation and data mining
\item
  Limitation to be aware of: Snapshot of the past, often with limited
  ability to help guide decisions
\item
  When to use: When you want to summarize results for all or part of
  your business
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Predictive Analytics: }

Predictive Analytics predicts predicts the business data in the future.
It need applies statistical techniques (often machine learning) to get
what the future may be happen.

Overview:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Question being answered: What might happen?
\item
  Examples of tools used: Machine learning, statistical models, and
  simulation
\item
  Limitation to be aware of: Guess at the future, helps inform low
  complexity decisions
\item
  When you want to use: When you want to make an educated guess at
  likely results
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Prescriptive Analytics: }

It optimized the set of decisions. Company can quickly evaluate
trillions or more possible combinations of choices (for example: what
products in which manufacturing, what product lines and in what
quantities), minimum production of a given product, manufacturing time
and cost, machine, raw material inventory, finished goods inventory
capacity, and maximize or minimize your objectives (for example: total
product costs).

Overview:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Question being answered: What should we do?
\item
  Examples of tools used: Optimization and heuristics
\item
  Limitation to be aware of: Most effective where you have some control
  over what is being modeled
\item
  When you want to use: When you have important, interdependent, complex
  or time-sensitive decisions to make
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SAP Business Object Web
Intelligence}\label{sap-business-object-web-intelligence}

SAP BO Web Intelligence is databases system created by SAP. The reason
for choosing this databases sytem is \texttt{robust\ software} (from a
few user to tens of thousand of users ) and \texttt{excellent\ service}
from SAP company. This SAP system have some another advantages, such as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  On-premise deployment (offline)
\item
  Real-time business intelligence (offline and offline)
\item
  Increased user autonomy
\item
  Make information consumption simple, personalized, and dynamic
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Open Refine}\label{open-refine}

Openrefine is a data manipulation tool which cleans, reshapes and
intelligently edit batch messy, and unstructured data. It is an open
source tool and its code can be reused in other projects too. OpenRefine
provides the flexibility to choose from a variety of data set
functionalities, which makes it even more user friendly. Users can use
this tool to get a big view of their data in terms of statistically
curved graphs. They can play with messy data without worrying about
risks.

\textbf{What } --A messy, unstructured, inconsistent dataset can be
explored using open refine. In general, it will be very difficult to
explore data through redundancies and inconsistencies. But, OpenRefine
gives several functions through which one can filter the data, edit the
inconsistencies, and view the data. It's a tool to clean the data.

\textbf{Why }- Spreadsheets can also refine a dataset but they are not
the best tool for it as Openrefine cleans data in a more systematic
controlled manner. While using historical data, we come across issues
like blank fields, duplicate records, inconsistent formats and using
Openrefine tool can help to resolve such issues.

\textbf{When }-Now data analysis play an important role in business.
Data analysts improve decision making, cut costs and identify new
business opportunities. Analysis of data is a process of inspecting,
cleaning, transforming, and modelling data with the goal of discovering
useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision
making. So, to ensure the accuracy of our analysis, we have to clean our
data.

\textbf{Why OpenRefine is a better tool for data cleaning and modeling:

\chapter{Terminology}\label{terminology}

\section{Balance Sheet}\label{balance-sheet}

\TeX~is the best way to typeset mathematics. Donald Knuth designed
\TeX~when he got frustrated at how long it was taking the typesetters to
finish his book, which contained a lot of mathematics. One nice feature
of \emph{R Markdown} is its ability to read LaTeX code directly.

If you are doing a thesis that will involve lots of math, you will want
to read the following section which has been commented out. If you're
not going to use math, skip over or delete this next commented section.

\section{Data Cleaning}\label{data-cleaning}

Chemical formulas will look best if they are not italicized. Get around
math mode's automatic italicizing in LaTeX by using the argument
\texttt{\$\textbackslash{}mathrm\{formula\ here\}\$}, with your formula
inside the curly brackets. (Notice the use of the backticks here which
enclose text that acts as code.)

So, \(\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}Cr_2O_4}\) is written
\texttt{\$\textbackslash{}mathrm\{Fe\_2\^{}\{2+\}Cr\_2O\_4\}\$}.

\noindent Exponent or Superscript: \(\mathrm{O^-}\)

\noindent Subscript: \(\mathrm{CH_4}\)

To stack numbers or letters as in \(\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}}\), the subscript
is defined first, and then the superscript is defined.

\noindent Bullet: CuCl \(\bullet\) \(\mathrm{7H_{2}O}\)

\noindent Delta: \(\Delta\)

\noindent Reaction Arrows: \(\longrightarrow\) or
\(\xrightarrow{solution}\)

\noindent Resonance Arrows: \(\leftrightarrow\)

\noindent Reversible Reaction Arrows: \(\rightleftharpoons\)

\chapter{KPIs for big data}\label{kpis-for-big-data}

\textbf{What is KPI? }

KPI (Key Performance Indicators) are the response to company fear of big
data, ugly spreadsheets and uncertain applications with unstructured
data. The idea of KPI is that company presenting big data easily and
also using business relevant language.

Key Performance Indicators are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Use rates, ratios, percentages and averages instead of raw numbers
\item
  Leverage tachometers and thermometers and stoplights instead of pie
  charts and bar graphs
\item
  Provide temporal context and highlight change instead of presenting
  tables of data
\item
  Drive business-critical action
\end{itemize}

Measuring the right KPI is vital to the health and success of the
company. Here are 5 reasons why You need KPIs.

Before we talks about use case in Deutsche Bahn. We need to understand
the types and classification of KPI terms based on perspektive,
industry, and etc.

\textbf{High level vs Low level KPI }

\texttt{High-level\ KPI} demonstrate the company's overall performance.
Examples of high-level KPIs include Annual Growth, Annual Recurring
Revenue (ARR), and Relative Market Share.

Single individuals have no impact on these KPI. They're the result of
teamwork across multiple departments and subsidiary company.

\texttt{Low-level\ KPI} indicate the performance of specific departments
or individuals. Low-level business metrics are tied to people's
day-to-day work and more actionable.

\textbf{Five essential questions for creating a KPI }

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What are the business results (goals)?
\item
  How can the KPI values be improved by taking action?
\item
  Do we have all the relevant data?
\item
  Who is going to use the KPI?
\item
  How to visualize specific KPI (graphs, metrics, diagrams, etc.)?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{How to choose the right KPI}

The most important thing is define a business goals. It is better to
focus on a few key metrics instead of many irrelevant ones. Ensure that
every single one of your business metrics meets the SMART criteria:

SMART KPIs are:

\textbf{S }pecific

\textbf{M }easurable

\textbf{A }ttainable

\textbf{R }elevant

\textbf{T }ime-Bound

\textbf{Note }

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Understand that Key Performance Indicators } are different for
  each industry, growth stage, and project phase.
\item
  \textbf{A KPI (Key Performance Indicator) } is a measurable value that
  indicates whether a team/company is reaching its targets (benchmarks).
\item
  \textbf{The five main types of KPIs } are business KPIs, financial
  KPIs, sales KPIs, marketing KPIs, and project management KPIs.
\item
  \textbf{KPIs are frequently monitored } with a real-time reporting
  tool -- KPI dashboard.
\item
  \textbf{Each KPI your monitor should meet the SMART criteria },
  i.e.~be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.
\item
  \textbf{Only track the metrics that are relevant} to your organization
  and business goals.
\end{itemize}

\section{Financial Perspective}\label{financial-perspective}

Based on the size, age, and industry, each and every company needs to be
conscious of their financial situation. The fastest and most efficient
way to keep track of a company business performance is to set up a KPI
that displays financial concern. Let's started with the most widely used
financial metrics that have the full spectrum of important budget.

Firstly, we need to understand the concept of balance sheet. Below is
the example of complete balance sheet.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{bs.PNG}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Operating Cash Flow (OCF)}\label{operating-cash-flow-ocf}

How much money generated by the regular operating activities of a
business in a specific time period.

\texttt{Formula\ (short\ form)}: Operating Cash Flow = Net Income +
Non-Cash Expenses -- Increase in Working Capital

\texttt{Formula\ (long\ form)} : Operating Cash Flow = Net Income +
Depreciation + Stock Based Compensation + Deferred Tax + Other Non Cash
Items -- Increase in Accounts Receivable -- Increase in Inventory +
Increase in Accounts Payable + Increase in Accrued Expenses + Increase
in Deferred Revenue

Below is an example of operating cash flow (OCF) using Amazon's 2017
annual report.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{amazon.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Let's analyze how the operating section counts:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Net income from the bottom of the income statement is used as the
  starting point
\item
  All non-cash items are ``added back'' meaning any accruals are
  reversed, including:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Depreciation, which an accounting method for expensing property,
    plant, and equipment (PP\&E) purchases
  \item
    Stock-based compensation is not paid out with actual cash, but
    instead with the issuance of shares
  \item
    Other expense/income could include various items such as unrealized
    gains or losses or accrued items
  \item
    Deferred taxes arise from the difference between accounting methods
    companies use when filing their taxes vs their financial statements
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Current Ratio}\label{current-ratio}

The ability to pay all the financial obligations in one year. A healthy
Current Ratio is between 1.5 and 3

\texttt{Formula}: Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities

Example of the Current Ratio Formula:

A business has:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Cash = \$15 million
\item
  Marketable securities = \$20 million
\item
  Inventory = \$25 million
\item
  Short-term Debt = \$15 million
\item
  Accounts Payables = \$15 million
\end{itemize}

then,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Current assets = 15 + 20 + 25 = 60 million
\item
  Current liabilities = 15 + 15 = 30 million
\item
  Current ratio = 60 million / 30 million = 2.0x
\end{itemize}

The company can easily settle each accounts payable twice.

\subsection{Ratio / Acid Test}\label{ratio-acid-test}

Indicates whether a business has sufficient short-term assets to cover
its near-future liabilities. The quick ratio deleted liquid assets such
as inventories.

\texttt{A\ common\ alternative\ quick\ ratio\ formula\ is}: (Current
assets -- Inventory) / Current Liabilities

Example:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Cash & \$60 & Accounts Payable & \$30\tabularnewline
Marketable Securities & \$10 & Expenses & \$20\tabularnewline
Account Receivables & \$40 & Notes Payable & \$5\tabularnewline
Inventory & \$50 & Long Term Debt & \$10\tabularnewline
Total Current Assets & \$160 & Total Current Liabilities &
\$65\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

The Company quick ratio as follows:

(\$60,000 + \$10,000 + \$40,000) / \$65,000 = 1.7

This means that for every money of Company current liabilities, the firm
has \$1.70 of very liquid assets to cover those immediate obligations.

\subsection{Burn Rate}\label{burn-rate}

Burn rate is the amount of time it will take a company to exhaust the
capital. Burn Rate is also in terms of cash burned per month, year , or
quarterly.

\texttt{Formula}: Burn Rate= Cash / Expenses

There are two types of burn rates: net burn and gross burn.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  gross burn: the total amount of operating costs it include in expenses
  each month.
\item
  net burn: the total amount of money a company loses each month.
\end{itemize}

Example:

A company spends \$5,000 monthly on office space, \$10,000 on monthly
server costs and \$15,000 on salaries and wages for its engineers, its
gross burn rate would be \$30,000.

However, if the company was already producing revenue, its net burn
would be different. Even if the company operates at a loss, with
revenues of \$20,000 a month and costs of goods sold (COGS) of \$10,000,
it would still work to reduce its overall burn. In this scenario, the
company's net burn would be \$20,000, derived as: \$20,000 - \$10,000 -
\$30,000 = \$20,000.

\subsection{Net Profit Margin}\label{net-profit-margin}

Indicates how efficient a company at generating profit compared to its
revenue.

\texttt{Formula}: Net profit margin = net profit / revenue

Check this example:

Company ABC and DEF both operate in the same industry. Which company has
a higher net profit margin?

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Company ABC & Income Statement & Company DEF & Income
Statement\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
Revenue & \$100 & Revenue & \$225\tabularnewline
Cost of Goods Sold & \$20 \_\_- & Cost of Goods Sold & \$35
\_\_-\tabularnewline
Gross Profit & \$80 & Gross Profit & \$195\tabularnewline
Operating Expenses & \$20 \_\_- & Operating Expenses & \$40
\_\_-\tabularnewline
Operating Profit & \$60 & Operating Profit & \$150\tabularnewline
Interest Expense & \$5 \_\_- & Interest Expense & \$10
\_\_-\tabularnewline
Earnings Before Taxes & \$55 & Earnings Before Taxes &
\$140\tabularnewline
Tax Expense & \$25 \_\_- & Tax Expense & \$60 \_\_-\tabularnewline
Net Income & \$30 & Net Income & \$80\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\textbf{Step 1 }: Write out the formula

Net Profit Margin = Net Profit/Revenue

\textbf{Step 2 }: Calculate the net profit margin for each company

Company XYZ:

Net Profit Margin = Net Profit/Revenue = \$30/\$100 = 30\%

Company ABC:

Net Profit Margin = Net Profit/Revenue = \$80/\$225 = 35.56\%

\textbf{Company ABC has a higher net profit margin. }

\subsection{Working Capital}\label{working-capital}

The difference between a current assets (like cash and goods) and
current liabilities (like debts or obligations).

\texttt{Formula}: Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

Example:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Cash & \$60 & Accounts Payable & \$30\tabularnewline
Marketable Securities & \$10 & Expenses & \$20\tabularnewline
Account Receivables & \$40 & Notes Payable & \$5\tabularnewline
Inventory & \$50 & Long Term Debt & \$10\tabularnewline
Total Current Assets & \$160 & Total Current Liabilities &
\$65\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Using the formula,the working capital ist:

\textbf{\$160 - \$65,000 = \$95 }

\subsection{Current Accounts
Receivable}\label{current-accounts-receivable}

How much money owed by its debtors. This account receivable helps to
estimate the upcoming income.

Let`s take a look the part of balance sheets.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Cash & \$60 & Accounts Payable & \$30\tabularnewline
Marketable Securities & \$10 & Expenses & \$20\tabularnewline
\textbf{Account Receivables } & \$40 & Notes Payable &
\$5\tabularnewline
Inventory & \$50 & Long Term Debt & \$10\tabularnewline
Total Current Assets & \$160 & Total Current Liabilities &
\$65\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

The account receivable ist \$40.

\subsection{Current Accounts Payable}\label{current-accounts-payable}

How much money owed by its creditors (bank, suppliers, . This account
receivable helps to estimate the upcoming expenses.

Let`s take a look the part of balance sheets.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Cash & \$60 & Accounts Payable & \$30\tabularnewline
Marketable Securities & \$10 & Expenses & \$20\tabularnewline
Account Receivables & \$40 & \textbf{Notes Payable } &
\$5\tabularnewline
Inventory & \$50 & Long Term Debt & \$10\tabularnewline
Total Current Assets & \$160 & Total Current Liabilities &
\$65\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

The account payable ist \$5.

\subsection{Inventory Turnover}\label{inventory-turnover}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How efficiently a company sells and replaces its inventory during
  period of time (daily, monthly, or yearly.
\item
  The bility to generate sales and quickly re-stock.
\end{itemize}

\texttt{Formula}: Inventory Turnover = Sales / Inventory or Inventory
Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory

Example:

Berlin's Paper Company sells office paper. During the current year,
Berlin reported cost of goods sold on its income statement of
\$1,000,000. Berlin's beginning inventory was \$3,000,000 and its ending
inventory was \$4,000,000. Berlin's turnover is calculated like this:

Inventory Turnover= 1,000,000/ {[}(3,000,000+4,000,000)/2)= 0,29

It means that Berlin Paper Company only sold a third (fast 30\%) of its
inventory during the year.

\subsection{Budget Variance}\label{budget-variance}

A budget variance is a different between the predicted cost or revenue
in a given account. (how projected budgets vary compared to actual
budget totals). Optimistic forecasting or poor leadership decisions
caused significant variance (big variance). This KPI used predictive
analytics with mathematical and statistical methoden.

\texttt{Formula}:Predictived Cost - Actual Cost

Not only the cost but also sales, projects budget, ect.

\subsection{Sales Growth}\label{sales-growth}

The growth of sales over a certain period (daily, weekly, quarterly, or
yearly).

\texttt{Formula}: Sales Growth= Current Period Net Sales - Prior Period
Net Sales) / Prior Period Net Sales * 100

Example:

Sales 2018: \$10 Mio Sales 2017: \$5 Mio

So, the sales growth is (10-5)/5*100= 100\%

A Sales hat increased by 100\% than last years.

\subsection{Days Sales Outstanding
(DSO)}\label{days-sales-outstanding-dso}

The average number of days required for clients to pay a company. If the
DSO is lower, company can focus ordering additional supplies.

\texttt{Formula}: DSO= {[}Accounts Receivable / Ne Credit Sales{]} * 365

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Accounts Receivable: \$25,000
\item
  Net Credit Sales: \$200,000
\end{itemize}

So, the DSO is {[}25/200{]} *365= 45.63

It takes 46 days to collect cash from the customers.

\subsection{Payment Error Rate}\label{payment-error-rate}

Uncompleted payments due to a lack of approval, poor documentation or a
missing reference.

\subsection{Complete List}\label{complete-list}

\section{Customer Perspective}\label{customer-perspective}

According to research from walkerinfo.com (customer research
consulting), customer satisfication will overtake as the key success.
Company require volumes of customers, number contacts, and number
employees, and another data as a key factors. It depend on the situation
and company business model.

Below are example of the most using KPI for Customer Perspektive:

\subsection{Customer Satisfaction Score
(CSAT)}\label{customer-satisfaction-score-csat}

Measuring CSAT is very hard. Customers need to express an emotion, and
emotions are harder to indentify than objective facts. CSAT can consist
of regular numbers, some icon (like stars, smiley faces, etc).

Example: Users uses a 5 stars scale for ratings

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Net Promoter Score (NPS)}\label{net-promoter-score-nps}

How likely customers are referring the products to someone else.

Example: Company ask the customers how likely they are to recommend the
products on a scale from 1 to 10.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\subsection{First Response Time}\label{first-response-time}

Customers are changed like the Spice Girls: ``If you wanna get with me,
better make it fast!''. The Customers expect an excellent shopping
experience. A Salesforce study found that a third of the respondents
felt positive about companies that offered a quick first response. First
Response Time is calculated by subtracting the time of the request from
the time of the initial reply.

\subsection{Customer Retention Rate}\label{customer-retention-rate}

The ability to keep a customer over a set period of time (daily,
monthly, yearly).

\texttt{Formula}: Customer Retention Rate = ((CE -- CN) / CS)) x 100

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  CE = Number of customers at end of period
\item
  CN = Number of new customers acquired during period
\item
  CS = Number of customers at start of period
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Employee Engagement}\label{employee-engagement}

\section{Process Perspective}\label{process-perspective}

\subsection{Cost performance index
(CPI)}\label{cost-performance-index-cpi}

The financial effectiveness and efficiency of a project. For example, if
a project has a earned value of £30,000 but actual costs were £12,000.

\begin{quote}
CPI = EV / AC = 30,000 / 12,000 = 2.5
\end{quote}

If the ratio has a value higher than 1 then it indicates the project is
performing good.

\subsection{Schedule Performance Index
(SPI)}\label{schedule-performance-index-spi}

Indicates how efficiently the company actually progressing compared to
the planned project schedule. It is the efficiency of the time on the
project.

\texttt{Formula}: Schedule Performance Index = (Earned Value) / (Planned
Value)

Example:

A Company have a project to becompleted in 12 months, and the budget of
the project is 100,000 USD. Six months have passed, and 60,000 USD has
been spent, but on closer review, you find that only 40\% of the work
has been completed so far.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}l@{}}
\toprule
Given in the question:\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
Actual Cost (AC) = \$60,000\tabularnewline
Planned Value (PV) = 50\% of \$100,000\tabularnewline
= \$50,000\tabularnewline
Earned Value (EV) = 40\% of \$100,000\tabularnewline
= \$40,000\tabularnewline
And then,\tabularnewline
Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = EV / PV\tabularnewline
= 40,000 / 50,000\tabularnewline
= 0.8\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

The Schedule Performance Index is 0.8

This Company is behind schedule since the Schedule Performance Index is
less than one.

\section{Human Resource and Innovation
Perspective}\label{human-resource-and-innovation-perspective}

\textbf{Retention }

The basic formula for employee retention is the following:

\begin{quote}
(\# of employees who stayed at the company for the whole time
period)/(\# employees at start of the time period) X 100
\end{quote}

Example : If 90 people were working at my company as of June 1st and 80
of those same people were still working at my company as of June 30th,
my retention rate for the month of June would be the following: 80/90 *
100 = 88.9\%
